                <p>According to the European Commission, an estimated 165 million Europeans are living with a brain disorder. These include neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, which are tied to a gradual loss of brain cells.</p>
                <p>A number of research projects launched by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, Europe's biggest public and private collaboration in life sciences, aim to better understand and develop treatments for these conditions. By establishing the Neuronet platform and connecting these projects, we hope to aid progress and expedite the delivery of novel treatments.
                Neuronet aims to help scientists to identify gaps in research, to make findings more visible for society as a whole and create links between Innovative Medicines Initiative projects and other international research initiatives.</p>
